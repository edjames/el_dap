h1. El Dap

A simple LDAP wrapper for search and authentication.

h2. Why make this?

The need for this gem arose out of a business requirement for all user authentication to be done against Active Directory. 
Our users were tired of having to remember multiple usernames and passwords, and asked if they could simply use their network 
credentials to log into our applications. This gem passes off their username and password to an Active Directory / LDAP server
for authentication.

Additionally, users are also able to search the Active Directory.

h2. Installation

Just add this to your gem file:

@gem 'el_dap'@
